# netmq-monitor-server
A sample application to try and understand how the NetMQ monitor type works

This was originall a throwaway application to try and figure out how the NetMQ
monitor type works (see the related netmq-monitor-client project for more
details). Putting this up so someone else can help me take a look at it.

I may clean this up into a proper example if we get it figured out.
